# PaniniQA
Repo for the TACL 2023 paper "PaniniQA: Enhancing Patient Education Through Interactive Question Answering"


### 1. Dataset 

We open source two datasets:

1. **Dataset 1** - 456 annotated discharge instructions from MIMIC-III Clinical Database
2. **Dataset 2** - 100 synthesized discharge instructions generated by pre-trained neural models)

#### Detailed instructions on Dataset 1
The 456 discharge instructions in Dataset 1 are from the MIMIC-III Clinical Database, a large freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
We provide all the annotation files in the folder ```data/annotated_dataset/annotated_files/```. There are two types of files in this folder: 
1. Files ending with ```evt.csv``` records key medical events in each discharge instruction. 
2. Files ending with ```rel.txt``` records key medical relations in each discharge instruction.
Each file is represented by a unique identifier in the form of *row_id-subject_id-hadm_id*.

Due to data security agreement, we can not release the discharge instructions in this repo, you will need to acquire the discharge instructions from MIMIC-III yourself.
To acquire these discharge instructions, please first obtain the credential from [here](https://link-url-here.org).
After acquiring the credential, please visit [this link](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/NOTEEVENTS.csv.gz) to download the file **NOTEEVENTS.csv.gz**.

Then run the following command to extract the clinical instructions from the downloaded file:

```
python scripts/data_process/extract_mimic.py \
  --input_file PATH/TO/NOTEEVENTS.csv \
  --anno_dir data/annotated_dataset/annotated_files/ \
  --output_dir data/annotated_dataset/raw_notes/
```

Once you have finished running the above command, you should be able to see 456 txt files (discharge instructions) in your folder ```data/annotated_dataset/raw_notes/```
